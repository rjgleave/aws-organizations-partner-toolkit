Partner Toolkit for AWS Organizations 
==================================================

This repository contains code to automate the setup of the master payer account and provide separation of concerns between the partner role (billing) and the institution role (org management).

The scripts included in this toolkit will implement the reference architecture shown below, including user groups, profiles, IAM policies, Service Control Policies (SCPs), Organization Units (OUs), etc. 

![Reference Architecture](https://github.com/rjgleave/aws-organizations-partner-toolkit/blob/master/assets/AWS-orgs-for-resellers-v2.png)

This model allows the partner to maintain ultimate ownership of the master payer account, including the root account profile.  

The root account profile will be used to create an organization, a parent OU and service control policies to apply at the organization root.  Those service control policies will automatically grant full access to all AWS services, while denying access to billing and cost features.  This will be true for any member account that joins the organization.    

The root profile will also create all IAM objects (groups, users and policies) to support billing and organization activities in the master payer account.  

Day-to-day activities in the master payer account will be carried out by two admistator profiles: the billing administrator and org administrator.   The billing administrator is granted full rights to all billing and cost functions.  The org administrator is granted rights to all AWS services at any OU below the Organization root.  This includes the ability to define OUs, SCPs and the ability to apply SCPs at any OU below the org root.  The org admin can also invite accounts to join the organization.  


What's Here
-----------

This repository includes:

1. README.md - this file
2. FOLDER: boto3 - standard AWS python SDK 
3. FOLDER: cloudformation - this contains cloudformation code to create
the following objects in the master billing account, including:
    *   IAM admin groups, users and policies
    *   IAM admin user profiles 
    *   IAM policies to protect the root organization and prevent unauthorized access to billing.
4. FOLDER: scp-examples  
5. FOLDER: iam-policy-examples
6. create_org_resources.py   This is a python script to fire a fully automated process which will eventually replace manual Org creation steps.  It will do the following:
    *   create the root organization - with all AWS services enabled
    *   create the institution's parent OU
    *   create reseller service control policies (SCPs)
7. create-all-resources.yaml   This is a cloudformation template which creates all of the IAM groups, roles and admin users described below.   

There are two options for resellers to build out this environment for a customer:

Option 1: Manual setup: Instructions
------------------------------------

To set up your master payer account, do the following:

1. Create a master payer account.

2. Create your organization.   Instructions here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_create.html  NOTE: Specify that you want to create the organization with ALL FEATURES enabled.

3. Create an OU within the root in your organization.   Instructions here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_ous.html Add other OUs to your organizational hierarchy as desired.

4. Create any service control policies that you would like to see enforced across all member accounts in the organization.  Attach those SCPs to the root OU.  Any SCPs applied at the root OU will cascade down to all member accounts in the organization.  See the SCP folder described above for examples.  You should tailor the SCPs to meet your own business requirements and operating model.  

Typically, resellers will start by whitelisting the use of all AWS services for their customer member accounts (see FullAWSAccessSCP) while denying access to billing and cost reporting (see DenyAllBillingSCP).  Each reseller should implement the policies that meet their business objectives. This link contains many other example policies: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-permissions-ref.html#ExampleAllowAllDenyBilling

Resellers should protect the SCPs that they define.  One way to do this is to specifically DENY changes to those specific policy resources.  Some of the example policies in this repository show how to protect specific resource ARNs.  Look for Resources with the account number 101010101010 to see them.  Substitute your root OU ARN and account numbers if you want to use these examples.   

An additional measure to protect SCPs is to deny access to the root OU for any customer admins (see DenyAttachPolicyRootOU).  Since all reseller SCPs will be attached at the root OU, this will help protect them as well.   

5. Run the cloudformation template to build all IAM groups, user profiles and policies.

6. Invite accounts into the new organization.



Option 2: Automated setup: Instructions
---------------------------------------

1. Create a master payer account.

2. Configure your AWS CLI so that it references your new master payer account (for more information, please see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

2. Run the script below from the command line.   It will perform steps 2-5 of the manual option, as described previously.

python create_org_resources.py --org_admin_password  [ORG ADMIN PASSWORD HERE]  --partner_admin_password   [PARTNER PASSWORD HERE]

3. Invite accounts into the new organization.
